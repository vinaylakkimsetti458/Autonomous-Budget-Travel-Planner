# Autonomous-Budget-Travel-Planner
A multi-agent travel planning system built with Streamlit, LangGraph, and Groq LLM that autonomously estimates flights, accommodation, food, and activities while strictly optimizing for a user-defined budget. The system generates a detailed, day-by-day itinerary and performs intelligent budget reviews when costs exceed constraints.
